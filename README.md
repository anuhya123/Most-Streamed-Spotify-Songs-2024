Exploratory Data Analysis in Python (https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2022/07/step-by-step-exploratory-data-analysis-eda-using-python/)
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a critical initial step in the data science workflow. It involves using Python libraries to inspect, summarize, and visualize data to uncover trends, patterns, and relationships. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key steps in performing EDA with Python:

1. Importing Libraries:
pandas (pd): For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy (np): For numerical computations.
Matplotlib.pyplot (plt): For basic plotting functionalities.
Seaborn (sns): A built-on top of Matplotlib, providing high-level visualization.

2. Loading the Data:
Use pd.read_csv() for CSV files, similar functions exist for other data formats (e.g., .xlsx, .json).

3. Initial Inspection:
Get an overview of the data using df.head(), .tail(), and .info().
Check data types with df.dtypes.4. Data Cleaning:
Identify and handle missing values using methods like df.isnull().sum().
Find and address duplicates with df.duplicated().sum().

5. Univariate Analysis:
Analyze single variables at a time.
Use descriptive statistics with df.describe() for numerical data.
Create histograms, box plots, and density plots to visualize distributions.

6. Bivariate Analysis:
Explore relationships between two variables.
Create scatter plots to identify trends and potential correlations.

7. Visualization:
Effective visualizations are crucial for understanding data.
Use various plots like bar charts, pie charts, and heatmaps to represent categorical data.
